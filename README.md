# ComfortCorner (Express)
An updated version of our hackathone project, using node.js and express.

## Future Improvement Ideas:
- Pause quote updating when the cursor hovers over the quote-container.
- Add more cards to homepage. Cards could be draged and dropped to be reorganized (may release some stress when you do this!).
- When clicked into the cards, there could be different AI features (e.g. automatically generates a funny and inspirational short story about managing anxiety).
- Back to home button on article pages.
- A dark background, so that the quote stands out. Dark Mode?
